# Project Blueprint

## Project Overview
This project is a Vue.js application using Vite for development and building. It aims to be a modern, performant, and maintainable web application leveraging Vue's Composition API and TypeScript. The development environment is Firebase Studio, with Node.js 20, Git, and VS Code (with `vue.volar` extension) pre-configured.

## Current Features
The application is currently in its initial state, with a basic Vue setup and a `HelloWorld.vue` component. It uses a default `src/style.css` for basic styling.

## Plan for Current Request

The user wants to integrate the PocketBase SDK into the project. This will involve the following steps:

1.  **Install PocketBase SDK:** Add the `pocketbase` npm package to the project dependencies.
2.  **Initialize PocketBase Client:** Create a new file, possibly `src/pocketbase.ts`, to initialize and export the PocketBase client instance.
3.  **Demonstrate Usage (Optional Initial Step):** For a quick verification, I might temporarily add a small snippet to `App.vue` or a new component to demonstrate basic interaction with PocketBase (e.g., fetching a list of records or logging in/out, if relevant to the next steps the user has in mind).

This plan will set up the foundation for using PocketBase in the Vue.js application.
